# Database queries

This folder contains scripts and queries I used to setup and 
run queries on the TimescaleDB instance. Before running, make sure 
that TimescaleDB's extension has been activated on your PostgreSQL
data base by running the following command. 

`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;`

You should then see a small graphic made up of text symbols showing
you have activated TimescaleDB.
