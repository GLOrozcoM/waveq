# Database queries

This folder contains sample scripts to illustrate my setup and 
main queries to run on the TimescaleDB instance. Before running TimescaleDB
dependant actions, make sure that TimescaleDB's extension has been activated on your PostgreSQL
data base by running the following command. 

`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;`

You should then see a small graphic made up of text symbols showing
you have activated TimescaleDB.
